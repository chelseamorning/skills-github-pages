Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
<BR>
And sorry I could not travel both
<BR>
And be one traveler, long I stood
<BR>
And looked down one as far as I could
<BR>
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
<BR>
<BR>
Then took the other, as just as fair,
<BR>
And having perhaps the better claim,
<BR>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
<BR>
Though as for that the passing there
<BR>
Had worn them really about the same,
<BR><BR>
And both that morning equally lay<BR>
In leaves no step had trodden black.<BR>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<BR>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<BR>
I doubted if I should ever come back.
<BR><BR>
I shall be telling this with a sigh<BR>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<BR>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<BR>
I took the one less traveled by,<BR>
And that has made all the difference.
<BR><BR>
